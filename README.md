# RockPaperScissors_Canvas

This sketch shows a canvas of (currently) 300 Rock/Paper/Scissor objects that move around the canvas randomly. 
Any time two objects collide, they'll "play Rock, Paper, Scissors", and the loser's image will change to the winner. Eventually, there'll be a canvas full
of only one image. Currently the number of each object type is randomly picked at the start of the function.
